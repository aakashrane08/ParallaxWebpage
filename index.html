            <p class="text">The Indian Premier League (IPL) (also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons) is a
                men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India. It is contested by ten teams based in seven
                cities and three states of India.[1][2] The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in
                India (BCCI) in 2007. Brijesh Patel is the incumbent chairman of the IPL.[3] Competition is usually held
                annually in summer (between March and May) and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours
                Programme, meaning that international cricket does not take place during that the IPL season.</p>
